	I, the undersigned am delighted to recommend Mr. Chinmay Deepak Pai, 
	for the Masters course at your acclaimed institution. He has been in 
	contact with me for the past two years of the course, during which I 
	have recognized him as a student with strong aptitude in the field of 
	Computer Science. I have had the opportunity to assess his skills and 
	distinguish his caliber amongst the selected lot of students owing to 
	his meticulous analytics and excellent computing skills.
	
	Being his professor for multiple semesters, I have taught him two courses:
	
	-
	-
	
	I describe him as a student who is assiduous, has admirable coding skills 
	and is blessed with a proclivity for continuous improvement. Also, his 
	meticulousness and ability to grasp and implement involved technical concepts 
	has put him ahead of his peers. He has proved himself as one of the most 
	talented students of my class.
	
	For Chinmay, I see the making of a true achiever, whose priorities are clearly 
	laid out. Another aspect that I would like to highlight is the degrees of 
	improvement and development that he has exhibited since the very beginning. 
	During the course he clearly demonstrated his skills in working on group assignments 
	and his eagerness to study the subjects in depth. I was ecstatic to see his 
	command on Java and Python. He has been able to get along very well with the 
	group and has been regular regarding the coursework. 
	
	I would also like to endorse him for his communication and presentation skills. 
	The fluency and elegancy with which he presented his projects was impressive. He 
	has also shown a lot of interest in Free and Open Source software foundation, 
	which is evident through his contributions on various git hosting platforms. 
	
	In all, I can say with self-assurance that Chinmay is a highly motivated student 
	and is well suited to pursue your graduate program. I believe he will adapt to the 
	demanding schedules and perform well in the chosen program at your institute. Because 
	of all the reasons mentioned above, I would strongly recommend his candidature for 
	higher studies without any hesitation.
	
	If you would like to discuss on this further, please feel free to contact me.
